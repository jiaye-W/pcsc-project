CMake Error at external/boost/CMakeLists.txt:20 (include):
  include could not find requested file:

    BoostRoot


CMake Warning (dev) at CMakeLists.txt:12 (find_package):
  Policy CMP0144 is not set: find_package uses upper-case <PACKAGENAME>_ROOT
  variables.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0144" for policy details.  Use the
  cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  CMake variable BOOST_ROOT is set to:

    boost

  For compatibility, find_package is ignoring the variable, but code in a
  .cmake module might still use it.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Warning (dev) at C:/Program Files/JetBrains/CLion 2023.2.2/bin/cmake/win/x64/share/cmake-3.27/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:438 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (Boost) does
  not match the name of the calling package (boost).  This can lead to
  problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
  (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
Call Stack (most recent call first):

  CMakeLists.txt:12 (find_package)
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
